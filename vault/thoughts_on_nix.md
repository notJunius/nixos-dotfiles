# Thoughts on Nixos being too hard for me
No. It isn't. At least not too hard for me to be able to program any language or project I want. 
Using Google Gemini and the knowledge I had of flakes and how go worked, I was able to get a flake
working for me to be able to program a go-raylib project in 30 min. I now have the confidence that 
if i don't know how to get something running, i can find the answers. And i have a solid resource 
for learning more about flakes that I will dive into as i progress. And I want to start making my 
config truly my own as well. Nix is nice because it has stability, and new tech, and I know that 
I am smart enough to truly master it, and will be able to make anything for any device with this 
knowledge.
